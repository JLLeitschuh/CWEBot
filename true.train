Extension URIs resource bypass Content-Security-Policy in Chrome and Firefox and can always be loaded Now if a site already has a XSS bug and uses CSP to protect itself but the user has an extension installed that uses Angular an attacker can load Angular from the extension and Angulars auto-bootstrapping can be used to bypass the victim sites CSP protection  -- githubcom.	2-SW-Cross Site Scripting XSS when loaded from an extension.

400	8398655539	Regular Expression Denial of Service ReDoS. Via the Node Security Project  is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service when user input is passed unchecked into momentduration blocking the event loop for a period of timeThe Regular expression Denial of Service ReDoS is a Denial of Service attack that exploits the fact that most Regular Expression implementations may reach extreme situations that cause them to work very slowly exponentially related to input size An attacker can then cause a program using a Regular Expression to enter these extreme situations and then hang for a very long time 1Its not a huge amplification it takes about 25k characters to get 11 seconds however thats well under most servers max request size so its certainly exploitableThe regular expression in questionmoment2106momentjs1679 var aspNetRegex  -ddddd3.	2-SW-Regular Expression Denial of Service ReDoS.
